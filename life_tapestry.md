Sure, I'd be happy to showcase some formatting skills! How about a formatted poem with some cool ASCII art mixed in? Here goes:

Each life is but a thread,
Woven into the grand tapestry,
A vibrant hue, a story to be read,
Stitched through time's vast expanse, eternally.

Some threads shine bright, like brilliant crimson rays,
While others blend, subdued in quiet grace.
Yet each one adds its own unique displays,
Enriching the design with its singular trace.

The great Weaver's hands work tirelessly,
Intertwining joy and sorrow, laughter and tears,
Crafting a masterpiece of complexity,
Encompassing the breadths of human years.

And though each thread may seem alone at times,
They're bound together in this work sublime,
A tapestry that transcends earthly climes,
A testament to life's rhythm and rhyme.

So let your thread shine forth with all its might,
Embrace the colors that make you truly you,
For in this tapestry, your vibrant light
Adds beauty to the ever-changing view.
